We are planning on making a multi-cycle CPU for lab 4. 

Deliverables:
Block diagram
Unit test benches for cpu, decoder, and any new components created
Assembly tests for final CPU
Necessary script(s) for running all the tests

Plan: The Lab will take two weeks to complete. We will finish the block diagram and do a midpoint check in with Ben in the first week (targeting Friday), and implement and test our design in the second week.

Work distribution:
The block diagram is going to be completed with all members working together from Monday-Thursday
From the block diagram we will determine the submodules we must make and corresponding unit tests. We will complete these over the weekend and divide evenly. 
We will try to hook up our CPU on Monday/Tuesday to allow buffer time to write new assembly tests and scripts.
We will write new assembly tests to verify unit functionality on Monday/Tuesday as we create the completed CPU and spend the remaining time debugging.


Resources:
The class slides will be the most useful when determining how we structure our multi-cycle CPU. We will also be relying on the prior group of Nick, Yichen, and Adam for core components of the CPU and associated test benches.
