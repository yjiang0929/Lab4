# Expected results of the test

The file will return the sum of N natural numbers. We input the N we want into $t0 register. We get the result in$v0

# Any memory layout requirements (e.g. .data section)

We use 7 temp registers, $t0-$t6, for operations and $v0 for storing the result.

# Any instructions used outside the basic required subset (ok to use, but try to submit at least one test program everyone can run)

All instructions are out of the basic required subset.
